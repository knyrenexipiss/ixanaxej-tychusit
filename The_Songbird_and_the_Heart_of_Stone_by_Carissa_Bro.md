 But when Mische is saved by Asar, the bastard prince of the House of Shadow with a past as brutal as his scars, sheâ€™s forced into a mission worse than execution: a journey to the underworld to resurrect the god of death himself.
 
 Yet, Mischeâ€™s punishment may be the key to her salvation. In a secret meeting, her sun god commands her to help Asar in his mission, only to betray himâ€¦ by killing the god of death.
