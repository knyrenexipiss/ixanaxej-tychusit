Overview
&quot;Molly Devereaux has been missing for more than two weeks, and police are still searching for the girl who seemed to vanish out of thin air. The world still wants to knowâ€¦ Where&#039;s Molly?&quot; In my dreams, I never escaped the Oregon woods. Life after death isn&#039;t easy to accept, especially when I still feel like a ghost. Now, I live deep in the mountains of Montana-the paradigm of beauty. But they are also the home of horrors. Horrors that I only unleash at night. When my pigs are allowed to feast. It is strongly recommended to read Haunting Adeline and Hunting Adeline before reading Where&#039;s Molly. Important Note: This is a dark romance that contains dark subject matter. Please refer to the author&#039;s website for content warnings
